          Hello! I am a senior at Northeastern studying Journalism and International Affairs. I graduate in August 2025 and am currently seeking full- or part-time positions in San Diego (or remote) that pair well with my broad range of editorial, communications and reporting experience.
        </p><p><br/>
I’m hoping to develop the intersection between the above subjects through reporting (including globally), academic writing, visual storytelling, data journalism and other mediums. I am also interested in photography, documentary making, language learning and copy editing.
</p><p><br/>
Last summer, I studied abroad in Peru and produced a video news report about Chancay Port, the country’s new $3.5 million megaport that will open in November and is expected to transform the economy. You can watch the story at: pulseofperu.sites.northeastern.edu/port-of-chancay-chinese-megaport-will-transform-peruvian-economy/.

This video is in the "Stories" section of this portfolio which contains samples of my published and unpublished work as well as some video and photo work. If you have questions about me, my skill set or my past/current experience, please feel free to reach out!
