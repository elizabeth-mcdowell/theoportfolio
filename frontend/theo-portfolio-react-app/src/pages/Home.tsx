          I am graduating in August 2025 from Northeastern University with a journalism and international affairs
          combined major with a minor in political science. I am interested in developing the
          intersection between the above topics through academic writing, global reporting,
          visual storytelling and data journalism. In addition to being an editor for Northeastern
          Universityâ€™s Global Journal, I am also member of
